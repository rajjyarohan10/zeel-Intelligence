# Custom Voice Assistant (Jarvis Clone) Project

## Description
This project is a personal side project by Rajjya Rohan Paudyal to create a custom voice assistant similar to Jarvis. The unique feature of this assistant is that it uses the voice of Zeel, a female friend of the author, instead of the traditional Jarvis voice. The project leverages advanced text-to-speech, speech recognition, and natural language processing technologies to achieve a seamless and personalized user experience.

# Project Overview

## Objective:
To create a custom voice assistant similar to Jarvis, using the voice of Zeel, a female friend of the author, instead of the traditional Jarvis voice.

## Key Components:

### Text-to-Speech (TTS):
Use Mozilla TTS to train a custom voice model based on Zeel's recordings. This model will be used to generate spoken responses in Zeel’s voice.

### Speech Recognition:
Use Vosk, an open-source speech recognition toolkit, to convert spoken commands from the user into text.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Implement Rasa, a robust framework for building conversational AI, to interpret user commands and manage the dialogue flow.

### Backend Logic:
Use Django, a powerful web framework, to handle the backend logic, managing requests, responses, and the integration of different components.

## Process Flow:

### Step 1: Speech Input
The user speaks a command, which is captured and processed by the Vosk speech recognition system.

### Step 2: Command Interpretation
The recognized text is sent to Rasa, where it is analyzed to understand the user’s intent and determine the appropriate response or action.

### Step 3: Response Generation
The text response generated by Rasa is then converted into speech using the custom TTS model trained on Zeel's voice.

### Step 4: Voice Output
The final spoken response is played back to the user, simulating a personalized interaction with the assistant.

## Personalization:
The project is highly personalized, with the assistant's voice being tailored specifically to Zeel, providing a unique and familiar user experience.

## Technology Stack:

- **Mozilla TTS**: For training and generating the custom voice.
- **Vosk**: For converting spoken language into text.
- **Rasa**: For interpreting and managing the conversational flow.
- **Django**: For backend integration and managing the overall application logic.

## Project Goals:

- **Primary Goal**: Successfully create a functional voice assistant with Zeel’s voice.
- **Secondary Goals**: Explore the potential
